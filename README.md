# CuttingBoard — iOS Recipe & Meal Planner

**CuttingBoard** is an unfinished iOS app intended as a recipe book and meal-prep planner — a way to have your recipes, grocery lists, and meal planning all in your pocket.

## Overview
Built with SwiftUI and SwiftData, CuttingBoard was a personal project to learn:
- SwiftUI app architecture and views
- SwiftData for local data persistence
- Structuring a functional, user-facing mobile app

## Features
- View & search recipes
- Create new recipes
- Plan meals (structure was in place, UI mostly ready)
- Local storage of recipes and meal plans via SwfitData

*(Note: The project is not maintained or deployed. Final design, data relationships, and polish remain unfinished.)*

## Technologies
- SwiftUI
- SwiftData
- Xcode (iOS)

## What I Learned
- Structuring data models and persisting them with SwiftData
- Implementing UI workflows and navigation with SwiftUI
- Handling boilerplate and architecture in Swift projects
- Project scaffolding — what I'm glad I set up, and where I’d refine it now

## Status
This project is no longer maintained; I decided to move away from iOS app development. However, it reflects a significant learning phase in my career, and it still serves as a demonstration of practical SwiftUI and SwfitData usage.
